## To Linux or not to Linux 
Since a couple months ago, i have decided to try and switch fully to linux and ditch that piece of junk they call windows.

Now, that's a bit misleading since i have been using windows for the past 12-13 years of my keyboard smashing journey but i don't really feel any guilt doing this, in fact windows is nothing more of a bottleneck to me *or so have i figured later*.

enough ranting, maybe this needs it's own blog post after all *or maybe not*, it's a highly controversial topic whatsoever. Just believe me windows is pure evil.

## Distro Hopping
Distro Hopping is pretty famous term amongst Linux enthusiasts, the thing with Linux that windows never have had is variety, Windows just throws their corporate customized OS at your face and you have to deal with it, Linux gives your freedom over that, you can make it your own to the full extent.

My first experince with linux was using backtrack r3, and i was still in middleschool at that time i really had no clue what i was doing, i was just trying to get reaver to work to slide inside that cheesy WiFi my neighbour has, i failed miserably tho.

I may have used linux on and off after that, but never was consistent using it as i was really used to windows and couldn't give up on my windows habits i guess.
